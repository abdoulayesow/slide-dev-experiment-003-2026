## Section 2: AI Fundamentals (0:15-0:40) — 8 slides

### Slide 6: What is Generative AI?
- **Simple definition**: "AI that creates new content based on patterns it learned from examples"
- **Analogy**: Like an extremely well-read assistant who can write, analyze, and summarize—but doesn't truly "understand" like humans do
- **Visual**: Simple diagram showing input → AI model → output

### Slide 7: How Does AI "Think"? (Simplified)
- **The pattern recognition approach**:
  - Trained on billions of text examples
  - Predicts what words/phrases likely come next
  - No memory between conversations (unless told to remember)
  - No access to your files (unless you share them)
- **Visual**: Simple flowchart, avoid technical jargon

### Slide 8: What AI Does Well
- **Green light tasks**:
  - ✅ Drafting emails and letters
  - ✅ Summarizing long documents
  - ✅ Explaining complex concepts simply
  - ✅ Organizing information
  - ✅ Brainstorming ideas
  - ✅ Creating templates and checklists
- **Visual**: Green checkmarks, relatable icons

### Slide 9: What AI Does Poorly (Critical Understanding)
- **Red light limitations**:
  - ❌ Can confidently state incorrect information ("hallucinations")
  - ❌ Struggles with very recent events (knowledge cutoff dates)
  - ❌ Cannot access external databases or systems
  - ❌ Makes calculation errors (even simple math)
  - ❌ Doesn't understand client context without your guidance
- **Key message**: "Think of AI as a talented junior colleague—fast but needs supervision"

### Slide 10: The AI Landscape (2024-2025)
- **Market snapshot**:
  - 83% of professionals now using AI tools
  - Average time savings: 5.4 hours/week across industries
  - Top use cases: Communication drafting, research, document analysis
- **The shift**: From "Should we use AI?" to "How do we use it well?"
- **Visual**: Simple bar chart or infographic

### Slide 11: Real Impact on Professional Services
- **Data from research studies**:
  - 55% more clients served per week (MIT/Stanford 2025 study on accounting)
  - 7.5 days faster monthly processes
  - 21% more productive hours
  - Similar gains reported across professional services
- **Visual**: Before/after comparison or stat callouts

### Slide 12: Why Now? The Perfect Storm
- **Four converging factors**:
  1. **Talent shortage**: Difficulty hiring across professional services
  2. **Increasing complexity**: Regulations, client expectations
  3. **Client demands**: Faster responses, more strategic advice
  4. **Technology maturity**: AI finally "good enough" for professional use
- **Visual**: Four-quadrant diagram

### Slide 13: Discussion Question
- **Prompt for engagement**: "In chat, share ONE task you did this week that took longer than it should have"
- **Facilitator note**: Collect 3-4 responses from different industries, acknowledge common themes
- **Transition**: "Let's see how AI might help with some of these..."

### Slide 17: The Problem with Most Prompts
- **Common mistakes participants make**:
  - Too vague: "Write an email about [topic]"
  - Missing context: AI has to guess your intent
  - Wrong format: Get a paragraph when you needed bullets
  - No audience consideration: Too technical or too simple
- **The result**: Mediocre outputs that require extensive editing

### Slide 18: Introducing the CRAFT Framework (Universal)
- **Large, memorable acronym display**:
  - **C** - Context
  - **R** - Role
  - **A** - Action
  - **F** - Format
  - **T** - Target audience
- **Note**: "This framework works across ALL industries—tax, real estate, legal, consulting, you name it"
- **Visual**: Each letter on separate line with icon

### Slide 19: CRAFT Breakdown - Context
- **C = Context**: "What's the situation?"
- **Examples across industries**:
  - Tax: "I'm preparing for a client meeting about year-end tax planning..."
  - Real Estate: "A first-time buyer just asked about closing costs..."
  - Legal: "I need to explain discovery process to a new client..."
  - Consulting: "We're proposing a digital transformation project..."
- **Why it matters**: Gives AI the background to provide relevant advice
- **Visual**: Speech bubble with context example

### Slide 20: CRAFT Breakdown - Role & Action
- **R = Role**: "What expert should AI be?"
  - "Act as an experienced [tax advisor/real estate agent/attorney/consultant]..."
  - "You're a [CPA/broker/paralegal/business advisor] explaining to..."
- **A = Action**: "What specifically should AI do?"
  - "Draft a letter that..."
  - "Summarize the key points of..."
  - "Create a checklist for..."
- **Visual**: Two-column layout with examples

### Slide 21: CRAFT Breakdown - Format & Target

### Slide 40: The Universal Data Privacy Rules
**NEVER input into consumer AI tools**:
1. ❌ Social Security Numbers or national IDs
2. ❌ Bank account or payment card numbers
3. ❌ Full client names paired with financial/sensitive data
4. ❌ Tax IDs, license numbers, case numbers
5. ❌ Exact client addresses
6. ❌ Specific dollar amounts tied to identifiable clients
7. ❌ Any information that could identify a specific client matter
- **Visual**: Red "prohibited" icons for each

### Slide 41: What IS Safe to Use
**✅ Safe for AI assistance**:
- Template communications (identifying info removed)
- General research questions
- Explaining concepts in plain language
- Creating checklists and procedures
- Analyzing anonymized data
- Drafting generic documents
- Strategic planning (general scenarios)
- **Key**: Remove all personally identifiable information first

### Slide 42: The Anonymization Technique
- **How to anonymize effectively**:
  - Replace names: "Client A", "Smith Family", "Company XYZ"
  - Round numbers: "$250,000" becomes "approximately $250K"
  - Remove specifics: "a manufacturing client" not "ABC Manufacturing Inc."
  - Genericize situations: "a small business owner" not your actual client
- **Example transformation** shown on slide
- **Works across all industries**
- **Visual**: Before/after comparison

### Slide 43: Enterprise vs. Consumer AI Tools
**Consumer tools (ChatGPT free, Claude free)**:
- May use conversations for training
