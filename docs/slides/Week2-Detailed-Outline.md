- **Visual:** Two-column layout, timeline

**Slide 8: User Stories Format**
- Title: "Writing Effective User Stories"
- Content:
  - **Standard Format:**
    - "As a [type of user]"
    - "I want [goal/desire]"
    - "So that [benefit/value]"
  - **Examples:**
    - Good: "As an environmentally-conscious user, I want to see my monthly carbon footprint trend, so that I can track my progress over time"
    - Bad: "Build carbon calculator" (no user, no value)
  - **INVEST Criteria:**
    - Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- **Visual:** Format template, good/bad examples side by side

**Slide 9: Acceptance Criteria**
- Title: "Defining Done for User Stories"
- Content:
  - **What Are Acceptance Criteria?**
    - Conditions that must be met for story to be considered complete
    - Written from user perspective
    - Testable and specific
  - **Format: Given-When-Then**
    - Given [context/precondition]
    - When [action/event]
    - Then [expected outcome]
  - **Example:**
    - Given I have entered my household size and monthly utility bills
    - When I click "Calculate Footprint"
    - Then I see my estimated monthly CO2 emissions in kg
- **Visual:** Format template with real example

**Slide 10: Story Points & Estimation**
- Title: "Story Points"
- Content:
  - **What Are Story Points?**
    - Relative measure of effort/complexity
    - Not time-based (not hours/days)
    - Team-specific (5 points means different things to different teams)
  - **What Affects Size?**
    - Complexity
    - Amount of work
    - Uncertainty/risk
  - **Common Scales:**
    - Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
    - T-shirt: XS, S, M, L, XL
  - Key: Focus on relative sizing, not absolute
- **Visual:** Fibonacci sequence, comparison graphic

**Slide 11: Planning Poker**
- Title: "Planning Poker - Team Estimation"
- Content:
  - **How It Works:**
    1. Product Owner reads User Story
    2. Team discusses and asks clarifying questions
    3. Each person selects estimate card privately
    4. Everyone reveals simultaneously
    5. Discuss differences (highest & lowest explain)
    6. Re-estimate if needed until consensus
  - **Benefits:**
    - Prevents anchoring bias
    - Surfaces different perspectives
    - Engages entire team
  - **Scrum Master Role:** Facilitate, timebox discussions
- **Visual:** Planning poker cards, step-by-step process

**Slide 12: Estimation Practice**
- Title: "Let's Estimate Together"
- Content:
  - **User Story 1:**
    - "As a user, I want to enter my monthly electricity usage, so that it can be included in my carbon footprint calculation"
    - Questions: What size is this? 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13?
  - **User Story 2:**
    - "As a user, I want to see a detailed breakdown of my carbon footprint by category (transportation, energy, food, waste), so that I understand where my biggest impact comes from"
    - What size is this compared to Story 1?
- **Visual:** Stories in cards, interactive format

**Slide 13: Creating Sprint Goals**
- Title: "Crafting a Powerful Sprint Goal"
- Content:
  - **What Makes a Good Sprint Goal?**
    - One sentence that describes Sprint's purpose
    - Focused on value/outcome (not features)
    - Provides flexibility in implementation
    - Motivates the team
  - **Examples:**
    - ❌ Bad: "Complete stories 1-5"
    - ❌ Bad: "Implement carbon calculator"
    - ✅ Good: "Enable users to understand their basic carbon footprint"
    - ✅ Good: "Launch MVP that helps 100 users track their first sustainability goal"
  - **Template:** "Enable [users] to [achieve outcome]"
- **Visual:** Bad vs Good examples, template

**Slide 14: Sprint Goal Benefits**

    - Enables team to make tradeoff decisions
    - Creates shared purpose
    - Helps with mid-Sprint adjustments
  - **Example Scenario:**
    - Goal: "Enable users to calculate carbon footprint"
    - Mid-Sprint: API for utility data unavailable
    - Decision: Can we still achieve goal with manual entry? YES → adapt
  - Without goal: Team stuck, unsure how to proceed
- **Visual:** Scenario flowchart, decision tree

**Slide 15: Capacity Planning**
- Title: "Understanding Team Capacity"
- Content:
  - **What Is Capacity?**
    - Amount of work team can complete in Sprint
    - Based on team size, Sprint length, and availability
  - **Factors Affecting Capacity:**
    - Planned time off / holidays
    - Other commitments (support, meetings)
    - Historical velocity
    - Team experience with technology
  - **Example Calculation:**
    - 6 developers × 2 weeks = 60 developer-days
    - Minus: ceremonies (6 days), support (4 days), learning (5 days)
    - Capacity: ~45 developer-days OR ~30-40 story points
  - **First Sprint:** Be conservative!
- **Visual:** Capacity calculation breakdown

**Slide 16: Sprint Backlog Creation**
- Title: "Building the Sprint Backlog"
- Content:
  - **What Goes In:**

    2. User can enter monthly electricity usage (3 points)
    3. User can enter monthly natural gas usage (3 points)
    4. User can enter vehicle miles driven (5 points)
    5. User can see total carbon footprint calculation (8 points)
  - **Total:** 21 story points
  - **Team Capacity:** 30 points (conservative first Sprint)
- **Visual:** Sprint backlog board

**Slide 42: Day 1 Daily Scrum**

    2. **Scope Adjustment:**
       - Keep Sprint Goal but reduce Story Points
       - Focus on household size + electricity only
       - Other features moved to next Sprint
    3. **Sprint Cancellation:**
