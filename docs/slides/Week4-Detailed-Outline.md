    - Conflicting priorities
    - No unified vision
    - ✅ Better: One PO for the product
  - ❌ **Integration Sprint:** Last Sprint for integration
    - Delays feedback
    - Hides problems
    - ✅ Better: Continuous integration
  - ❌ **Scrum of Scrums:** Just for status updates
    - Becomes meeting overhead
    - ✅ Better: Nexus Daily Scrum with focus
- **Visual:** Anti-patterns with corrections

**Slide 20: Scaling Wisdom**
- Title: "Keys to Successful Scaling"
- Content:
  - **Do:**
    - ✅ Start simple, scale when needed
    - ✅ Invest in technical practices
    - ✅ Feature teams, not component teams
    - ✅ One Product Owner, one Product Backlog
    - ✅ Frequent integration
    - ✅ Shared Definition of Done
